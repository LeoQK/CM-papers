## Part 1 - What I learned from creating four courses at Johns Hopkins

#### Introduction

Over two years, while still a student, I developed and taught four versions of a professional development course on AI strategy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). CAPS, short for *Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy*, was built to help international relations students tackle AI. 

CAPS reached over 75 students, became the first student-taught professional development course to be accredited at SAIS, and received mentorship from leaders like InQTel's Sarah Sewall and OpenAI's Jack Clark.

In a series of posts, I want to share the lessons I learned from teaching an accredited course as a student and why I believe It's so important that more students develop and share their own courseware. Iâ€™ll also talk about the challenge of teaching AI to students who come from non-technical backgrounds and what might be best practices for enabling generalists to contribute to and benefit from AI. 

In this post, I review how CAPS got its start as an informal programming study group. The next posts will look at how CAPS grew over time and became an accredited course. 

#### A simple observation

Back in the spring semester of 2018, CAPS started with a simple observation. M.A. students at SAIS wanted to learn how to code but there were no relevant classes or workshops offered on our Washington campus.

I was one of these students. Coming from a background in the humanities, I realized that technology was transforming the careers in conflict resolution on which I wanted to embark after graduation. Like other students, I thought learning how to code was a way to keep up with this transformation. As there were no classes on campus, I decided to set up weekly meetings where we could discuss online courseware on programming and help each other tackle exercises. This was the humble beginning of what became CAPS. 

#### From meetings to lectures

As these informal meetings were getting started, it became clear that the model of "learn on your own and improve as a group" didn't work. Each student was new to programming and there were tons of questions on basics like what are the differences between for and while loops. Often, students hadn't watched the online lectures or only skimmed them. Instead, students wanted our discussions to be more like lectures. 

That's how I got started teaching CAPS. Instead of organizing meetings, I pivoted to teaching lectures. As I was new to programming myself, I binge watched online courseware, wrote handouts and, at the end of each week, I would present small lectures on programming in Python to the few students who attended. The lectures were far from optimal but it was important to me to keep going, even if only two or three students would attend. I always brought coffee for everyone as a compensation for the uneven teaching. 

#### Learning under pressure

During this time, I was struggling with balancing my commitment to other classes and teaching CAPS. Learning how to code was overwhelming but I felt I should deliver value for students who took an hour and a half off their schedule each Friday to attend CAPS. 

What I learned at this stage is that **teaching is decision-making under uncertainty**. When you set out to teach a course as a student, a lot uncertainty will be coming your way. Students will have uncertainty whether you can deliver value to them. School officials will have uncertainty about why a student should even be teaching a course. And you'll have uncertainty about your own ability to teach with confidence, especially on a topic that might be new to you but that you believe is mission critical for everyone to know. I learned to appreciate that teaching without having certainty can be a great way forward. When a topic needs to be heard, just taking the first step is more important than getting the delivery absolutely right. 

I also learned that **attrition is inevitable**. When you're operating under uncertainty, some students will decide that it's not worth their time and drop out. Don't get discouraged and focus on those who attend. 

If it's an informal course without accreditation, **the stakes are low and you can experiment**. The course is a service that you offer without any official responsibility, so experiment with what works and what doesn't.  For CAPS, this would change when the course became accredited. 

**Even when you're overwhelmed, celebrate the effort you're making**. Throughout the first lectures, I was stressed out about finishing and printing the handouts in time, booking the class room, running for coffee and delivering a solid lecture in-between my other commitments. It's important to realize that you're making a great effort and to celebrate that even when the whole endeavour seems rushed and unplanned. This also helps students form a community around the course, which in turn can help you retain students.

Perhaps the most important lessons I learned is that you should **make your students part of your team**. If students are engaged, the course will be fundamentally better. This is especially true if you're teaching to fellow students and it's important to communicate to each student that everyone is part of the same team. In practice, this means always listening to students' feedback, allocating lots of room for discussion, and championing if students want to present a solution or other task. Two students who took the second version of CAPS, Henry Fung and Cory Combs, would become my co-instructors for versions three and four. 

#### Looking ahead

The first version of CAPS concluded after eight weeks. I learned a lot about teaching but was left wondering whether learning Python syntax is how international relations students can maximize their impact on technology. After the first version of CAPS had ended, I went to San Francisco for an internship that blew up pretty much as soon as I had arrived there. Instead, I spent my time thinking about how to improve CAPS. 

In the next post, I'll discuss the second version of CAPS.
