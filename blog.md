## What I learned creating four courses at Johns Hopkins

Over two years, while still a student, I developed and taught four versions of a professional development course on AI strategy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). CAPS, short for *Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy*, was built to help international relations students tackle AI. 

In this post, I want to share some lessons learned on teaching an accredited course while still a student and why I believe more students should develop their own courseware. Iâ€™ll also talk about the challenge of teaching AI to students who come from a non-technical background and what might be best practices for developing education that allows generalists to contribute to and benefit from AI. 

This will be a long post, but let's start with a simple overview of CAPS. 

### Overview

Back in the spring semester of 2018, CAPS started with a simple observation. M.A. students at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS for short, wanted to learn how to code but there were no relevant classes or workshops offered on campus.

I was one of those students. Coming from a background in the humanities, I realized that technology was transforming the careers in conflict resolution that I wanted to embark on after graduation. Like the other students, I thought learning how to code was a way to keep up with this transformation. As there were no classes on campus, I decided to set up weekly meetings where we could discuss online courseware on programming and help each other tackle exercises. This was the humble beginning of what became CAPS. 

Over the next two years, here's what the course achieved:

* Reached over 75 graduate students
* Along with my two co-instructors who joined after a year, we became the first student-taught professional development course to be accredited at SAIS 
* Developed a curriculum focused on helping students understand how the decision-making of humans and machines can be aligned to achieve robust and ethical decisions
* Collaborated with leaders in the field of applied AI, like InQTel's Sarah Sewall, OpenAI's  Jack Clark, and the Applied Physics Lab's Ashley Llorens
* Presented the course to SAIS's Dean Vali Nasr to advocate for more education on AI strategy and policy

To get to these results was a long process and meant confronting a multitude of challenges. 

### The challenges of creating a course as a student

#### First steps

As the informal meetings where we discussed online courseware were getting started, it became clear that the model of "learn on your own and improve as a group" didn't work. Each student was new to programming and there were tons of questions. Often, students hadn't watched the online lectures or only skimmed them. Instead, they wanted our discussions to be more like lectures. 

That's how I got started teaching CAPS. Instead of organizing meetings, I started to teach lectures. As I was new to programming myself, I binge watched online courseware, wrote handouts and at the end of each week, I would present small lectures on programming in Python to the few students who attended. The lectures were far from optimal but it was important to me to keep going, even if only two or three students attended. I always bought coffee for everyone as a compensation for the uneven teaching. 

During this time, I was struggling with balancing my commitment to other classes and teaching CAPS. Programming was overwhelming but I felt I should deliver value for the students who took one and a half hours off their schedule each Friday to attend CAPS. 

What I learned at this stage is that **teaching is decision-making under uncertainty**. When you set out to teach a course as a student, there'll be uncertainty about your capabilities. Students will have uncertainty whether you can deliver value to them. School officials will have uncertainty about why a student should even be teaching a course. And you'll have uncertainty about your own ability to teach with confidence, especially on a topic that might be new to you but that you believe is mission critical for everyone to know. I learned to appreciate that teaching without having certainty about a topic can be a great way forward. When a topic needs to be heard, just taking the first step is more important than getting everything right. 

I also learned that **attrition is inevitable**. When your operating under uncertainty, some students will decide that it's not worth their time and drop out. Don't get discouraged and focus on those who attend. 

If it's an informal course without accreditation, **the stakes are low and you can experiment**. This is a service that you offer without any official responsibility, so experiment with what works and what doesn't. 

**Even when you're overwhelmed, celebrate the effort you're making**. Throughout the first lectures, I was stressed out about finishing and printing the handouts on time, booking the class room, running for coffee and delivering a solid lecture in-between my other commitments. It's important to realize that you're making a great effort and to celebrate that even when the whole thing seems super rushed and ad-hoc. 

Lastly, **focus on your true fans and make them part of your team**. This is perhaps the most important lesson that I took away from the first version of CAPS.
